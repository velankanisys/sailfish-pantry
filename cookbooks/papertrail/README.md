## Overview

Connect syslog to papertrailapp.com.

## Recipes 

* `default`                  - Base configuration for papertrail

## Integration

Supports platforms: debian and ubuntu

Cookbook dependencies:

* rsyslog


## Attributes

* `[:papertrail][:logger]`            - Logger to use. Support loggers include: rsyslog. Defaults to rsyslog. (default: "rsyslog")
* `[:papertrail][:remote_host]`       - Papertrail host to send stats to. Defaults to `logs.papertrailapp.com`. (default: "logs.papertrailapp.com")
* `[:papertrail][:remote_port]`       - Port to use. No default.
* `[:papertrail][:cert_file]`         - Location of papertrail certificate file (default: "/etc/papertrail.crt")
* `[:papertrail][:cert_url]`          - URL to download certificate from (default: "https://papertrailapp.com/tools/syslog.papertrail.crt")
* `[:papertrail][:hostname_name]`     - Explicit override of system's hostname
  - By default, this recipe will log to Papertrail using the system's hostname. If you want to set the hostname that will be used (think ephemeral cloud nodes) you can set `hostname_name` (preferred) or `hostname_cmd` (used if `hostname_name` is absent).
* `[:papertrail][:hostname_cmd]`      - Command to run to determine system's hostname
  - By default, this recipe will log to Papertrail using the system's hostname. If you want to set the hostname that will be used (think ephemeral cloud nodes) you can set `hostname_name` (preferred) or `hostname_cmd` (used if `hostname_name` is absent).
* `[:papertrail][:watch_files]`       - Command to run to determine system's hostname
  - A list of files that will be to watch and include in the papertrail logging -- useful for including output from applications that aren't configured to use syslog.
    
    Each entry in this list is a hash of:
    * [:filename] - Full path to the file.
    * [:tag] - What to tag log lines that come from this file. Best to use a short application name.
    
    For example:
      default[:papertrail][:watch_files] = [{:filename => "/var/log/myapp.log", :tag => "myapp:"}]
